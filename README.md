<p><p>Hello! Welcome to my profile 👋 I'm Sofi, a FullStack Developer trained at SoyHenry's Bootcamp 👩🏻‍💻, and a Industrial Designer graduated from the National University of Córdoba 👩🏻‍🎓. I'm also an entrepreneur 💪🏻 and currently working as a Henry Assistant at SoyHenry 👩🏻‍🏫.<p/>
<p>Throughout my life, I've been passionate about Design in all its aspects, and I'm a very curious person constantly seeking new knowledge. 📖🧐<p/>
<p>As an Industrial Designer, I wanted to explore Web Design, so I started taking UX UI courses, and that's how I discovered the IT world and programming. I found a place where I can combine all my knowledge and passion for design, having the necessary tools to bring it to life, and I love it. 💕<p/>
<p>Changing careers was a challenge, but I easily adapted because I enjoy pushing myself to achieve new knowledge and experiences that help me grow both professionally and personally.<p/>
<p>Being a team player is my favorite way of working, and this new profession allows me to keep growing with the support of my colleagues and peers. Thanks to my fellow students who chose me, I became a Teaching Assistant, a role in which I further developed my soft skills, such as teamwork, leadership, communication, and I was awarded the "Proactive" badge by the votes of my students, fellow TAs, and the Henry Assistant at that time. Based on my performance during this stage and the feedback I received, I was selected as the Henry Assistant for the upcoming Henry cohort 🤝
  <p>I'm always delighted to keep growing, learning, collaborating, and working with great passion and dedication to achieve the best results in each project I get involved in. 🚀✨
  If you're looking for someone like me, don't hesitate to get in touch. It would be a pleasure to work together! 😊<p/></p>
